Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The goal of this project was to create a clock to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock using the user's local system time. The user also has the option to increment the time(hours, minutes, seconds) with menu options.

What did you do particularly well?
  I think the display functions I wrote work very well. The clock stays centered and net looking even with the incrementing numbers.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I would like to come back to this code and eventually have it count on it's own rather than being a static clock that you change. I would also like to include code to change time zones.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging code to write was getting the system time in the proper format.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I learned how to look at and understand some of the included C++ libraries online, using the base information from them to include in my own code.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I used a lot of comments to describe what sections of my code did. I also used functions to display the clock so they can be easily mutated if anything were to be added or changed.
